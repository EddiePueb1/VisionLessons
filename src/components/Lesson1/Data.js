  task: 'Play around with the sliders and observe the changes',
  objective: 'As you see, the color and values inside the box change as you move the sliders. Computers recognize colors with three different values: Red, Green, Blue (RGB). Within each color, there is a range between 0 and 255. This particualr number indicates how much color value is designated to the combined color. In short, computers recognize colors with RGB values which are simply numbers. However, this creates a problem in the future.  '
